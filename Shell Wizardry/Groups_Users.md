# 💽 Linux Groups and Users

Linux is a multi-user operating system where users and groups are fundamental concepts for managing access and permissions.

> **Users**  
> A user is an account that can log into the system and perform tasks.
> - A User ID (UID) - a numeric identifier
> - A home directory (usually `/home/username`)
> - A default shell (like `/bin/bash`)
>> **Types of Users:**  
>> - **Root user** — The superuser with UID 0, has complete system access 
>> - **Regular users** — Normal accounts for people using the system 
>> - **System users** — Created for running services/daemons (like `www-data` for web servers)
